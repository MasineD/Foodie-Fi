/**************** D.Outside The Box Questions ******************/

/*
1.I would calculate the percentage of customers who have not churned since joining. Then track the changes
	 in this percentage periodically. An increase over time would mean growth.
2.The percentage of customers who churn after the free trial as compared to those who proceed to other plans.
3.The number of days it took for a customer to upgrade, downgrade to a different plan or churn. I would also
	 analyse content they watched or received days-maybe 7 days, prior to upgrading, downgrading or churn. 
	 This would help to know the type of content that influences customers to upgrade, downgrade or churn. To
	 improve customer retention, provide the content that influences customers to upgrade.
4.What influenced the customer to cancel the subscription?
	What did the customer enjoy or like the most throughout the journey?
	What the customer did not like throughout the journey?
    How likely is the customer to recommend the program to someone else?
	What would the customer suggest for improvements?
5.Following the free trial, provide a special like 25% OFF for first time users. This is due to that some people
	may not be able to afford even the basic plan. At the end of the free trial, ask customers whether and why 
	they would like to proceed to a subscription or churn. This would help to know what influences customers to
	churn, and then eliminate that factor.
